                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                    this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey

                        a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                        adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.

                        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                        assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                        whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                        from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                        field may be required to play all their games away.
